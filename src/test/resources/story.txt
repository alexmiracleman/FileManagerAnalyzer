Tell me another duck story duck.
A duck walked up to a corner store.
And he said to the woman, running the store
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"
The woman said
"No, it's a corner store.
I mean grapes aren't really what we're known for.
We've got some grape drinks?"
The duck said.
"They kinda stink"
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle).
'Til the very next day.
(Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum).
When the duck walked up to the corner store.
And he said to the woman, running the store.
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"
The woman said:
"Oh, it's you again, duck.
I already told you you're out of luck.
We've got some grape gum?"
The duck said
"I'll take none".
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle).
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle).
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle).
'Til the very next day.
(Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum).
When the duck walked up to the corner store.
And he said to the woman running the store.
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"
The woman said.
"Look, I'm trying not to shout.
But please either buy something or get out!
We don't sell fruit!"
The duck said.
"I'm kinda cute".
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle).
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle waddle).
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle).
'Til the very next day.
(Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum).
When the duck walked up to the corner store.
And he said to the woman running the store.
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?".
The woman said.
"That's it!.
The next time you ask for grapes.
I'm gonna tape you to the wall with this duct tape.
Do I make myself clear?"
The duck said.
"Yes, dear".
Then he waddled away.
(Waddle waddle).
Then he waddled away.

And he said to the woman running the store.
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) got any grape chapstick?".
"What?"
"Got any grape chapstick?"
"Actually we do.
But you don't have any money do you?"
"Do you think you could...
